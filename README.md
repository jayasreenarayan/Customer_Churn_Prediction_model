Predicting Customer Churn with Machine Learning & Power BI! 
Customer retention is a key business challenge, and understanding churn can help businesses take proactive steps. I recently worked on predicting customer churn using machine learning and visualized the insights with Power BI.
🪪 Dataset : Kaggle Telecom Customer Churn Data 

🔍 What I Did:
-Data Processing (ETL): Cleaned and transformed data using SQL Server.
- Feature Engineering & Selection: Identified key churn drivers using feature importance analysis.
- Churn Prediction Model: Trained a Random Forest model in Python to predict potential churners.
- Power BI Dashboards: Created interactive visualizations to highlight patterns in customer demographics, contract types, and service usage affecting churn.

Improvements to do :
1.Remove unwanted attributes to get a better churn rate
2.Try different ML models 
📈 Key Insights:
🔹 Month-to-month contracts had the highest churn rate (~46.5%).
🔹 Customers with paperless billing & no security services were more likely to churn.
🔹 Payment methods & tenure played a crucial role in customer retention.
By leveraging SQL + ML + BI, businesses can anticipate churn and take proactive retention measures before losing customers.
